# Node.js API for Login, Registration, and Posts

This project provides a Node.js API for handling user authentication (login and registration) and managing posts.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

Before running the server, make sure to set up the configuration variables. You may need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and define the following variables:

PORT=3000
DB_URL=<your-database-url>
SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key-for-JWT>

javascript
Copy code

Replace `<your-database-url>` with the URL of your database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL), and `<your-secret-key-for-JWT>` with a secret key for JSON Web Tokens (JWT) encryption.

## Usage

To start the server, run:

npm start

sql
Copy code

The server will start running on the specified port (default is 3000). You can now access the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or by integrating it with your front-end application.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/login**: Log in a user and receive a JWT token for authentication.
- **GET /api/posts**: Get all posts.
- **POST /api/posts**: Create a new post.
- **GET /api/posts/:postId**: Get a specific post by ID.
- **PUT /api/posts/:postId**: Update a specific post by ID.
- **DELETE /api/posts/:postId**: Delete a specific post by ID.

Make sure to handle authentication using JWT tokens for protected routes.
